# Transtive Closure of Tree #

The "TransitiveClosureOfTree" repository contains an implementation of the transitive closure of a binary tree data structure using a recursive algorithm.

The transitive closure of a tree is a matrix that represents the reachability relationship between nodes in the tree. In other words, it indicates whether there is a path from one node to another node in the tree. The implementation included in this repository uses a recursive algorithm to compute the transitive closure of a given binary tree.
